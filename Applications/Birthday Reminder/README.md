You can create a normal birthday reminder program using `python`. You need to set the date and time of the birthday and reminder and you'll get an reminder of your or your friend's birthday notification. But I feel that this program is useless because you've to keep this code runnig... we can create a notification to make this code cooler and ready to public use. Well, develop and add features to this code mr. `Developer` `Researcher`

```
What the program does?

- User will select birthday
- User will select time of the reminder
- In that day | time program will wish her/him a happy birthday ❤️
```
